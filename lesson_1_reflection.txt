How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can see what change you have made, then think why these change cause the different in behavior of you code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Sometimes you want to find an old idea. Sometimes you mess things up and want to roll back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatically save can avoid file missing due to accident like power down. But if everything is working, you don't need save all the changes, it's different for you to find a perticula one.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A project can contain more than one file.
